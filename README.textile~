h1. Stale Site Reporter

This package generates a report that identifies stale directories within a given website structure.

h2. Notes

* A directory is considered to be as new as the most-recently-edited .html file contained within that directory or its subdirectories.
* Top-level directories are included in the report by default. They can be excluded from the report, and subdirectories can be flagged for inclusion in the report as needed.
* Only sites older than the configured staleness threshold will be included in the report.
